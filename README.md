# Array-Methods
The point of this application is to show understanding of JS.
OOP implemented by prototypes, IIFE (Immediately-Invoked Function Expression), DOM rendering, array methods, work with JSON,
simple form validation...

To understand structure of JS code please open main.js in Sublime, VS code or your favourite editor :)
and collapse all functions. Use functions name to navigate.
